## What is LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) ?
LDA is a method used in statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events (Wikipedia). In the Titanic Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) we use this method in order to predict survival of passengers in the Titanic.
